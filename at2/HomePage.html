       <h2>Why i chose my course</h2>
       <h3>Why i chose IT</h3>
       <p>I have been interested in IT for many years and i belived it would be a good mostly future proof industry to work in. I completed year 12 with 3 of my 5 subject being in IT, so study IT in uni was the obvious choice. </p>
       <h3>Why i chose software engineering</h3>
       <p> I chose software engineering over other IT degrees as i am primaraly interested in programing, and i do not have as much of an interest in other areas in IT such as cyber security and networking.</p>

    <!-- 2nd paragraph   -->
    <article> <h2>Why i chose UNISA</h2>

       <h3>Why i choose to move to Adelaide</h3>
       <p>Before i moved to Adelaide i lived in and around Newcastle my whole life, which is where i completed Highschool. At the end of year 12 i needed to either get my own place in Newcastle  or move to a new area, so i decided to move for uni.</p>

       <p>There where multiple locations i was considering moving to, such as melbourne, woolongong, rockhamption and adelaide. i eventually decided on Adealide due  to a combination of factors.</p>

       <h3>Why i chose UNISA over other universities in Adelaide </h3>
       <p>From the research i did UNISA seemed to have a higher quality of education, particulally in IT then the other uni's in adelaide so i chose to study here. </p>
